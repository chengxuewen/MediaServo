# Prototypes CHANGELOG

## v0.2 — 2026-11-13 (w2-live-wall)
Fix (user review): the leftmost **portal navigation** was missing in v0.1 — restored it.
- Layout is now the full three-region order: **portal nav (232px) → selected-streams rail (250px) → canvas**,
  matching W1's grouped nav (Surveillance / Communication / Control / Administration).
- Nav: Live active, collapsible to a 56px icon rail, Live badge = live selected-stream count,
  keyboard-reachable items; other apps toast their target board (per-board loop scope).
- v0.1 archived (`archive/w2-live-wall-v0.1.html`); board sidecar gains region A0 (nav).
- Verified: both scripts node --check; DOM refs zero missing; div/nav/aside tags balanced; HTTP 200.

## v0.1 — 2026-11-13 (w2-live-wall)
New board W2 (Live wall), per web-portal-ui P9 per-board loop. Borrows workbudy Live mechanisms
(provenance in `boards/w2-live-wall.md`) and implements the W2 hard requirement:
- **Column-driven layout + pagination** (NOT a fixed rows×cols matrix): "N per row" combobox (1–4)
  drives `--cols`; page capacity = cols × 2 rows; `‹ 1/2 ›` pager; stream count uncapped, adding
  streams grows pages. Changing columns re-flows + re-paginates.
- **Device→stream selection** modal (device-grouped, search, add) + **selected-streams rail**
  (idx/thumb/name/res/state-glyph/remove).
- **Per-tile stats overlay** (FPS/RES/BIT/JIT/RTT/LOSS/CODEC/DRIFT) via Stats toggle; **Sync** gates
  per-tile drift; tile zoom = full stats card.
- stage-bar (rail toggle + counts + Sync + Stats + columns + pager), state grammar (dot/3-seg bar/
  hollow-ring), stale WS banner, empty state. Dual theme, custom combobox (no native select).
- Verified: both scripts pass node --check; 44 DOM ids, zero missing refs; pagination math tested
  (3 cols → 2 pages [6,2]); HTTP 200.

## v0.2 — 2026-11-12 (w1-portal-shell)
Rework per web-portal-ui **P8** (workbudy transplant: borrow patterns, change boundaries).
Fixes the 4 self-violations the expert panel caught in v0.1, and lands the borrowed design rules:
- **3-layer tokens** (primitive → semantic → component) + **dual theme** (`data-theme` light/dark,
  no-flash resolve, topbar toggle ◐). Admin light + dark both first-class; video letterbox dark in both.
- **State grammar**: no state by hue alone — solid dot (held/online), 3-seg bar + rtt/loss numbers
  (degraded/queued), hollow-ring-slash (offline/signal-lost), triangle (warning/unknown). Added a
  degraded tile (CAM-03, link 2/3) and kept the offline tile (CAM-04).
- **Removed all infinite animation** (v0.1 pulsed live/floor lamps) → static indicators; transitions ≤150ms.
- **Video tiles radius 0** (was 10px); **weights 400/600 only** (was 500/700); system font stack;
  tabular-nums slashed-zero on timers/counters; space/radius from token scale.
- Role badge → neutral chip (no hue); combobox/segmented controls (no native `<select>`).
- Screens unchanged in scope: Live wall / Intercom board / Tower / Settings; WS-drop → floor UNKNOWN demo kept.

## v0.1 — 2026-11-12 (archived: archive/w1-portal-shell-v0.1.html)
First exploration draft: shell + 4 screens, control-room night palette, full interactivity.
Superseded by v0.2 (violated the borrowed rules: infinite animation, tile radius, weight 500/700, dark-only).
